<hr> 
<p> Hey there! I am Nuh Naushad Khan, and I am a 9th Grade student. I am 14 years old [you can wish me on 19th march ;) ]. Well, by the time you are here you must be knowing this is my Personal Portfolio (I don't think so it's any personal now). Okay, so I know every person might like to include his hobbies in his personal portfolio; outdoor games, reading, coding are mine though. /p> br> p> Now, let me tell you how my interest in coding began. It started a long-long-long way before, when i was 3 years old......JUST KIDDING!! Well, it started when I was roughly 10 years old, at that time my father worked in the coding/data management/data analysis/web designing stuff and stuff. He always used to tell me that learn python, as it was not that trendy then, but he knew that this language had a lot of potential and if i learn this comupter language, I could be securing my future at a very young age! But I usually just didn't pay attention to what he said so I didn't know that until more 3 years. After 3 years, when i was in 8th grade, I suppose...I had my my exams and I had SQL server and ummmm... I forgot what else I had with it (I apologises, my memory takes time to refresh). So at night, I went to him and asked if he could just help me out with this. And you know what? It was like the anger of a nuclear bomb had dropped on me! He scolded me and told me that he wouldn't help me now, as I know that is just dumbness to do this at night just before exams. That night after MUGGING up all theory chapters ( as i didn't knew a thing about SQL, it was kida confusing for me, soooo.....I don't usually mug up) I was lying down on the bed trying to sleep, and telling to myself that"What will I do now!!??, if I don't get full marks, my parents will transfer me to another school, and I loved my currnet school, and I do still.(don't give a thought about me marks it was the lowest ever in my life a 92%, my target was like 97%, but like after 2 weeks or so my parents gava me second chance. I am really Greateful for that MOM and DAD. Love u both <3 ) Then, when I was in 9th i started python and html. I liked html as i wanted to learn basics first. My dad told me the most amazing coding website that is "w3schools". Then I started coding made these webpages that you are seeing now. Soooo well then... Long story short, this was my begining of computer language coding!</p>

<br> 
<p>P.S:Idk, but those who read all of this, here's a wholesome heart for u "<3" thanks appreciate that a lot!</p>
